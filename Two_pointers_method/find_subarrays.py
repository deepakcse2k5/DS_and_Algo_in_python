# Subarrays with Product Less than a Target 

# Input: [2, 5, 3, 10], target=30 
# Output: [2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]
# Explanation: There are six contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.
# sliding window takes O(N)O(N)O(N) but creating subarrays can take up to O(N^2) in the worst case.
# Therefore overall, our algorithm will take O(N^3)
# Ignoring the space required for the output list, the algorithm runs in O(N) space which is used for the temp list.
#So, at most, we need space for O(N^2) output lists. At worst, each subarray can take O(N) space, so overall, our algorithmâ€™s space complexity will be O(N^3).

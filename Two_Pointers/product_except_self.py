# Time complexity
# The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list arr.
# This is because we iterate through the list once, using two pointers to traverse the list from both ends.

# Space complexity
# The space complexity of this solution is O(1),
# since it doesnâ€™t use any additional array for computations but only constant additional space.
